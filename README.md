# recursion-activity

Since the course will be getting into tree based data structures (which 
are inherently recursive in their structure). I think it would be good 
to review the topic of recursion. 

This is graded based on where we get with it in lecture. It's also intended 
to give you more practice working with the terminal and git.

## Steps:

1. clone this repo
2. follow along with the recording in M05-ACT02 on canvas,
   complete the `countDownThenUp` as done in the video.
2. implement and write jUnit tests for the 
     bunny ears method

## Handin instructions:

1. you will submit a screenshot on canvas of both your `CountDown` class and your junit test class
