# recursion-activity

Since the course will be getting into tree based data structures (which 
are inherently recursive in their structure). I think it would be good 
to review this topic. 

This is graded based on where we get with it in lecture. It's also intended 
to give you more practice working with the terminal and git.

## Steps:

1. clone this repo
2. implement the `countDownThenUp` method (follow along with me in class)
2. implement the `bunnyEars` method and write jUnit tests for this method

## Handin instructions:

1. you will submit a screenshot on canvas of both your `CountDown` class and your junit test class
